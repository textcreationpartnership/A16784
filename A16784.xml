            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I had ſet dovvne in vvriting by ſeueral articles the cauſes of my comming in, and made certaine demaundes moſt reaſonable.

One copie of this writing I determined to keepe with me: that if I ſhould fal into the officers hands it might goe with me: an other copie I laide in a frendes hand, that when my ſelf with thother ſhould be ſeazed on, thother might therevpon ſtreight be diſperſed.</p>
                     <p>But my ſaid frend kept it not cloſe longe but divulged it, and it vvas redd greedely, whereat the aduerſaries vvere mad, anſvvering out of their pulpits, that them ſelues certes would not refuſe to diſpute but the Queenes pleaſure was not, that matters ſhould be called to queſtion, being already eſtabliſhed. In the meane while they teare and ſtinge vs with their venemous tonges, callinge vs ſeditious, hypocrites, yea, heretikes too, which is much laughed at. The people herevpon is ours, and that error of ſpreadinge abroade this vvritting, hath much aduaunced the cauſe. Yf we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:18182:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> and may haue ſafe conduct, we vvill into the courte.</p>
                     <p>But they meane nothing leſſe, for they haue filled all the old priſons with Catholikes, and novv make nevv, and in fine plainely affirme, that it were better to make a fevv traitors avvay, then ſo many ſoules ſhould be loſt.</p>
                     <p>Of their martyrs they bragge no more novv, for it is novv come to paſſe, that for a fevv apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tats and coblers of theirs burned, we haue Biſhops, Lordes, kinghtes, the old nobility, paterns of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pietie and prudence, the flovvre of the youth, noble matrones, and of the inferiour ſorte innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, either martyred at once, or by conſuming priſonement dyinge daily. At the very vvriting hereof the perſecution rageth moſt cruelly, the houſe where I am is ſadd: no other talke, but of death, flight, priſon, or ſpoile of their frendes. Neuertheles they proceede with courage.</p>
                     <p>Very many euen at this preſent being reſtored to the Church, nevv ſouldiars geue vp their names, whiles the old offer vp their blood. By which holy hoſtes and oblations, God will be pleaſed: and we ſhall no queſtion, by him ouercome.</p>

Vvherevpon calling for a Catholike Prieſt, he reconciled him ſelf to the Church, forſooke the ſacrilegious fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Miniſtrie, abandoned his wrongfully gotten and holden benefice:<note place="margin">The hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſay he could not gett lerning inough to be a Prieſt ſo quickly, and yet they thought him lerned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to be a Miniſter 4. or 5. yeres before.</note> and ſo paſſed ouer to Romes.

            <p>He had his intent, and ſo came into England. Vvhere he had not been long, but aduenturing one day to goe viſit certaine priſoners in the Marſhal ſee: there he was apprehended, &amp; being examined by an Officer, what he was, and from whence he came, without more adoe confeſſing boldly him ſelf to be a Catholike, a Prieſt, and a Seminarie man of Rhemes: vvas therevpon caſt into Nevv-gate amongeſt theeues and laden with yrons.

Vvhere <hi>M Flitvvod</hi> the recorder ſitting in iudgement, aſked him where he was made Prieſt, what was the cauſe of his comming into England, and the like.

Then (ſaith he) you are a ſubiect to the POPE? ſo I am ſir ſaith <hi>M. Haunſe,</hi> to which <hi>M.

            <p>Vpon which moſt true and ſyncere confeſſion, the Heretikes (as their faſhion is to falſifie althings and by contriued ſclaunders to to make odious the ſeruants of God) gaue out aftervvard in print that he ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">Hovv here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes bely the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note>
